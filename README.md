## Installation
Download the latest version from releases, the name should look something like this: ``networx-installer-latest.zip``, extract it and run ``bundle`` in the extracted folder, then run ``ruby install.rb``. Please note Windows users must add the install to their PATH manually.

Another thing of note is that the installer will automaticlly detect your Operating system so there is no need for different installers for different Operating systems, but do keep in mind that only some Operating systems are supported and trying to install Networx on an unsupported Operating system will only result in an error.
## Usage
Run ``ruby main.rb`` in the folder that contains networx, or if instaled using the installer, just run ``networx`` anywhere
## Features
- Built-in internet speedtest
- Internet connectivity checker
